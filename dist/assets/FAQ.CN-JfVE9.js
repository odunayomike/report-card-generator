Once verified, you can start using SchoolHub immediately with our 7-day free trial.`},{question:"Is there a free trial available?",answer:"Yes! We offer a 7-day free trial for all new schools. No credit card required. You can explore all features of your selected plan during this period. After the trial, you can choose to continue with a paid subscription."},{question:"What do I need to get started?",answer:"You only need basic information about your school: school name, address, contact details, and your email. You can add student and teacher information later from your dashboard."},{question:"Can I import existing student data?",answer:"Yes, you can bulk import student data using our CSV upload feature. You can also add students manually one at a time.

All plans include unlimited students, unlimited teachers, and all features with no hidden fees."},{question:"What payment methods do you accept for school subscriptions?",answer:"We accept all major payment methods including card payments (Visa, Mastercard, Verve), bank transfers, and mobile money through our secure payment partner, Paystack.

The price you see is what you pay. However, when parents pay school fees through the platform, a ₦200 platform fee is charged per transaction to the parent (not the school)."},{question:"How does the parent payment platform fee work?",answer:"When parents pay school fees online via our parent app, they pay a ₦200 platform fee per transaction. The school receives 100% of the fee amount. This platform fee helps us maintain secure payment infrastructure and provide ongoing support. If parents pay by bank transfer through Paystack, they only pay ₦200. If they pay by card, Paystack adds their standard 1.5% + ₦100 fee."},{question:"Can I change my subscription plan?",answer:"Yes! You can upgrade or switch plans at any time from your account settings. When upgrading mid-cycle, you only pay the prorated difference. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing period."},{question:"Do you offer refunds?",answer:"Yes, we offer a full refund if you're not satisfied within the first 7 days of your paid subscription. Contact our support team within this period to process your refund request."},{question:"What happens when my free trial ends?",answer:"After your 7-day free trial, you'll need to subscribe to a paid plan to continue using SchoolHub.

Bank transfer payments have no Paystack fees - just the ₦200 platform fee."},{question:"Can parents pay in installments?",answer:"Yes! Parents can make partial payments toward any fee. The system tracks all payments and outstanding balances automatically.

Payments made via card or bank transfer are automatically verified. Schools can also see real-time payment notifications in their dashboard."},{question:"What if a parent uploads a fake bank transfer receipt?",answer:"All bank transfer receipts require manual verification by the school before the payment is marked as complete.
